;INPUT
;    J,H,K          float[nsrc] -- three vectors containing the J, H,
;                                  and K magnitudes for a set of NSRC
;                                  sources. These must all be on the
;                                  same photometric system.
;KEYWORD PARAMETERS
;   XR=,YR=         float[2] -- Standard IDL XRANGE and YRANGE
;                               plotting range keywords.
;Set /OPLOT if you simply want to overplot annotations on an existing
;plot
;Set /AXES to make empty plot axes with appropriate labels.
;Set /twomass if plotting data taken using 2MASS K-short filter
;(OMIT FOR UKIDSS PHOTOMTERY). DO NOT MIX DIFFERENT PHOTOMETRIC
;SYSTEMS ON THE SAME PLOT!
